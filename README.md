<p> The Jupyter Notebook is used for demonstration class on 13th April 2022. A bit on sharing with my juniors on Basic Text Processing.
The first section consist on tokenization, stemming and lemmatization using classic method. 
On 2nd part, the demonstration used mainly Spacy libary to simplify text processing tecnique. 

  <em>Shoutout to Dr Rohana to invite me for 1 hour demonstration session</em>
